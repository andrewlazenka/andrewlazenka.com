          humbling experience being the small fish in a big pond, but that just
          means there are so many opportunities for growth.

          <br />I was part of a small & scrappy team that helped to launch{' '}

          in Feburary 2023, and since then I've been investing in React tooling
          for a "something new" project the Billing team has been working hard
          to ship.

          November 2022 I asked the love of my life is she would marry me.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unfortunately for her, she said yes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Having lived separately our entire relationship, we finally made
          arrangements to move in together at the end of May 2023. Our current
          place is extremely affordable, but comes at the cost of a longer
          commute for my fiance. Our plan is to save like crazy, get married
          fall 2024, and eventually buy a place we can call home.

          played our first show on June 8th at The Piston in Toronto. We were
          lucky enough to find ourselves on another bill in August which was
          equally as fun.

          It's been a great time getting the boys back in the room together.
          Jamming, laughing, and bonding over music.

          It's been said that AI will have as great, if not greater, an impact
          than the invention of the Internet.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do I believe this? Maybe. But that doesn't take away from the shear
          amount of innovation taking place! Starting in tech, and quickly
          spanning across industries.
          <br />
          <br />
          To seize the opportunity and make a small contribution to this new era
          of computing, and friend & I have been collaborating to create{' '}
          <ExternalLink to="https://herby.ai">HerbyAI</ExternalLink> - a chat
          bot with high-quality, curated, personalized herbal information.

          <br />
          We're passionate about our mission to democratize access to herbal
          knowledge. It's been extra rewarding being able to flex both my
          developer + business chops.
