            The Merging of Two Lives
          </h2>
          November 2022 I asked the love of my life is she would marry me.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unfortunately for her, she said yes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Having lived separately our entire relationship, we're finally making
          plans to move in together. I've been splitting my time at her place in
          Toronto and commutting back home for work during the day.
          <br />
          <br />
          Having set ourselves a 4 year goal to become homeowners, we'll be
          joining forces in Markham in the coming weeks, slowly savings our
          pennies to have a place we can call our own.

            Riding the Wave of AI
          </h2>
          It's been said that AI will have as great, if not greater, an impact
          than the invention of the Internet.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do I believe this? Maybe. But that doesn't take away from the shear
          amount of innovation taking place! Starting in tech, and quickly
          spanning across industries.

        Welcome to my corner of the metaverse!
      </h2>
      I'm a software engineer devoting my efforts to building scalable,
      resilient, highly available systems.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 2020, about a month after the world shutdown, I completed my
      undergraduate studies at Queen's University to receive a Bachelor in
      Computer Science with a specialization in Software Design.
      <br />
      <br />I have a passion for learning new technologies and incorporating
      them into my work. Right now I'm gravitating towards memory efficient,
      portable languages such as{' '}

      projects my go-to styling library is{' '}

      and the latest addition to my full-stack palette is{' '}
      <ExternalLink to="https://remix.run">Remix</ExternalLink>.
